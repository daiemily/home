		<h1>Yarn: The <span class = "blue">Fundamentals</span> of Knitting</h1> 
			<p>Yarn is the one material that makes knit creations unique and special. The colour, the texture, <br>
			and the size can completely change the end result of a pattern. Thus, it's important to select the <br>
			best type of yarn for certain patterns. However, with the endless possibilities, it can feel <br>
			overwhelming when choosing the right yarn. <br>

			If you're feeling clueless when choosing the right yarn, check out my guide! <br>

				<p>In knitting, you don't always need to stick to one type of yarn! By mixing and <br>

				<span class = "yarn-font-size">
				On all yarn bundles, they have a section with all the required needle size and gauges. <br>
				Here is an example of one:

			<!--Different fibres section-->
			<h1 class = "fibre-heading" id = "fibre">Different Fibres</h1>
				<p class = "fibre-paragraph">
				Aside from the thickness of the yarn, there are also different materials of yarn.<br>
				Some are soft and silky while some are rough and rigid. All these textures depend on <br>
				the material of the yarn. <br>
				<br>
				Most of the yarn you would find at your local craft store will probably be made of <span class = "blue"><b>synthetic <br> 
				fibres</b></span> including <span class = "blue"><b>acrylic</b></span> or <span class = "blue"><b>polyester</b></span> as they are cheap yet durable. Despite their durability, <br>
				they are not great for clothing pieces like shirts and sweaters since the material doesn't <span class = "blue"><b>breathe</b></span> <br>
				as well as a material like cotton. These yarn bundles are perfect for beginner knitters as they <br>
				practice knitting and create their first designs. <br>
				<br>
				Once you feel comfortable knitting and you are ready to start your first major project, <br>
				it's time to invest in good quality yarn! More specifically, <span class = "blue"><b>natural fibres</b></span>. Natural <br>
				fibres are made from natural materials including <span class = "blue"><b>silk, wool, cotton, mohair</b></span>, and <span class = "blue"><b>cashmere</b></span>. <br>
				These fibres are much softer, insulating and durable compared to synthetic fibres. For this <br>
				reason, they are also more expensive. However, these fibres are worth the price when making <br>
				a project that will last forever. <br>

			<!--Different colours section-->
			<h1 class = "colour-heading" id = "colour">Colours</h1>
				<p class = "colour-paragraph">
				One of the most exciting parts when choosing yarn is finding the perfect colour combination. <br>
				In the yarn world, there are an infinite number of colours to choose from. From <span class = "blue"><b>speckled to <br>
				solids, pastels to dark shades, neon to gradients</b></span>, there are colours for every project out there. <br>
				<br>
				It doesn't stop there. By combining different yarn colours together, you can gradients of your <br>
				own! In addition, if you want to create certain patterns, you can use the  switch between yarn <br>
				colours in the middle of a row to create designs! If you want to know more about this technique, <br>
