		<h1>Needles: The <span class = "blue">Machines</span> of Knitting</h1> 
			<p>Knitting needles are the &quot;machines&quot; in knitting; without them, it's impossible to create anything!
			<br>
			However, in order to create the numerous wonderful designs and patterns, we need different needle types.
			<br>
			Needles come in many different forms, some thick or thin, others straight or circular, but all of these <br> needles are the roots of our creations.
			Despite the many variations, all needles are separated into two types:

			<h1 class = "history-heading">History <br>
				<span class = "history-paragraph">
				In the early <b>Christian era</b>, knitting needles and <br>
				hooked needles were invented in the <b>Middle East</b>. <br>
				Soon after, numerous citizens recognized the <br>
				<b>simplicity</b> and <b>efficiency</b> of knitting needles and <br> 
				began developing their designs. Knitters started <br>
				taking <b>multiple needles</b> to knit <b>circles</b> which led <br>
				to the creation of <b>circular needles</b>. These inventions <br>
				lasted centuries, making their presence in today’s <br>
				society a form of <b>art</b>. 
				<br>
				As we discovered more resources, we started <br>
				creating needles out of all sorts of materials, <br>
				not just wood or steel. Today, needles are <br>
				created using <b>resin, acrylic, metal,</b> and all <br>
				kinds of <b>wood</b>!

		<!--Fun fact paragraph-->		
		<h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
			<p>
			In order to prevent stitches from falling off the needles, knitters use 
			<b><span class = "blue">stitch stoppers</span></b>!<br> <!--Change colour and bold important text-->
			Stitch stoppers are rubber stoppers that you put on each end of your needles!<br>
			They can have multiple different colours, sizes and shapes! ☆♡☆ ------------------------>

		<!--Straight needles section-->
		<h1 class = "straight-needles-heading" id = "straight">Straight Needles</h1>
			<p class = "straight-needles-paragraph">
			Straight needles are the typical knitting needles you might see in media. They are composed <br>
			of two separate needles with two stoppers are the end of each needle to prevent stitches from <br> 
			dropping. Straight needles are used mainly for flat pieces including scarves, cloths, coasters, <br> 
			and more! Despite their popularity, straight needles can feel uncomfortable around the wrists <br>
			and prevent knitters from knitting for long hours. Additionally, their limited length restrain <br>
			knitters from making larger patterns such as blankets and sweaters. However, don't let this <br>
			discourage you! Straight needles are perfectly fine for any knit project, as long as you have <br>
			something to sew your pieces together, like a darning needle! <br>
			</p>

		<!--Circular needles section-->
		<h1 class = "circular-needles-heading" id = "circular">Circular Needles</h1>
			<p class = "circular-needles-paragraph">
			Circular needles are similar to straight needles; however, they have a cable that connects <br>
			two ends together. This allows knitters to knit in a full circle as well as knit larger pieces <br>
			such as blankets, sweaters and more! Since the needles are shorter and the cable is flexible, <br>
			they feel more comfortable around the wrists, making them <span class = "blue"><i>ergonomic</i></span> needles! <br>
			Despite the needles being connected, circular needles can also be used to knit flat pieces like <br>
			scarves and cloths. For this reason, they are more versatile than straight needles! So, when you <br>
			are looking for a pair of needles to pick up, pick circular ones! <br>
